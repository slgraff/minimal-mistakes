I found myself in need of designing a new business card for my wife's dog treat business, [Handsome Hound Dog Treats](https://handsomehounddogtreats.com). I'm vaguely familiar with the need to keep in mind bleed area and safe printing area when creating a new design. While [Vistaprint](https://vistaprint.com) does provide their [Business Card Guidelines](https://www.vistaprint.com/hub/business-card-dimensions) I wasn't sure of how to translate these into action when creating the image in [Pixelmator Pro](https://www.pixelmator.com/pro/) (a really fantastic graphics editor for the the Mac!).

Reading the [alignment guides](https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.0/#1000) help article on the Pixelmator Pro Help website I found how to create guides, then set my sites to creating a new template file that includes guides for both the bleed area[^1] and safe printing area[^2]. To create this template I created a new file in Pixelmator with dimensions of 3.61" x 2.11" at a resolution of 300 dpi. I then added guides for the bleed area (the outer guides) and the safe printing area (the inner guide lines).

To use this [download it](https://github.com/slgraff/slgraff.github.io/raw/5963c6e27ecf85752e3fe022cb9b0c121b60f86c/_posts/VistaprintBusinessCardTemplate.pxd), open it in Pixelmator Pro, then select `Duplcate` from the `File` menu. Go to town designing your new Vistaprint business card!


[^1]: In printing, bleed is printing that goes beyond the edge of where the sheet will be trimmed.
[^2]: The safe printing area is a smaller dimension than your final image size. Any content outside of this area may be cut off.
